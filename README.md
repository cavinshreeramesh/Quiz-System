# Quiz-System
	The "Quiz Test" application is a Java-based quiz platform developed as part of a
	project review. The project's primary objective was to create an interactive quiz
	application with a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to answer a series of
	questions.

	 The Quiz Test application is designed to facilitate a quiz-taking experience for users.
	It presents a series of multiple-choice questions and records the user's responses. At
	the end of the quiz, the application provides a score based on the number of correct
	answers. The project combines Java programming with a MySQL database to store
	and manage the quiz questions.
